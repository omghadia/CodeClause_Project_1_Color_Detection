Introduction : Color Detection Using Data Science is a project that utilizes data science techniques and machine learning algorithms to detect and identify colors from images. The goal of this project is to extract prominent colors from an image, and it can be used in various applications such as image processing, graphic design, and color-based analysis.

Methodology : The color detection methodology is based on the following steps:
1. Load the image and convert it into a format suitable for analysis (ie in RGB and HSV format)
2. Select the HSV values for some specific colors.
3. Detect those colors in the image.
4. Display the colored region.

Dataset : The project does not require any specific dataset during runtime.However we need to import 2-3 images to work on.

Dependencies : The project relies on the following Python libraries and their dependencies:
1. numpy
2. opencv-python

Results : The output images showing the results of the color detection algorithm are present in the jupyter notebook.
