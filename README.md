Introduction
Color Detection Using Data Science is a project that utilizes data science techniques and machine learning algorithms to detect and identify colors from images. The goal of this project is to extract prominent colors from an image, and it can be used in various applications such as image processing, graphic design, and color-based analysis.

Methodology
The color detection methodology is based on the following steps:

Load the image and convert it into a format suitable for analysis (ie in RGB and HSV format)
Select the HSV values for some specific colors.
Detect those colors in the image.
Display the colored region.
